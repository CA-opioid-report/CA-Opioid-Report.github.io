This project was developed by Kaylee Kang, Jiro Walters, and Ronny Hu in Serdar Tumgoren's Building News Applications class in Winter 2024.

We wanted to explore the opioid epidemic currently ongoing in California. Through data visualizations, maps, and reporting, we aimed to illustrate how opioids have affected the state over a decade.
